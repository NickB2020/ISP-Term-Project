<h2 style="font-size:200%;"> The Architecture</h2>
<p style="font-size:150%;"> <b>The architecture of the project is a arcade-style game that stores the score in a php database using html,
			       javascript, and php.
			   	 Html is used for the canvas, and for the buttons on screen.
			   	Encapsulated by the html, javascript is used in an object oriented fashion to create classes for the player, projectiles, and enemeies.
			   	Many useful methods like random and math, set intveral, set timeout, and splice are used to enable the ememies and proejctiles to work together to function in a game like matter, 
			       there is an array for both the projectiles and the enemies which use the splice method to elimate from the arrays.
		  	   	Events and event listeners are used to enable the "clicking" action of the game. I've made a few functions, such as
				animate which calls for the animation frame, spawn enemies triggers the randomly genereated enemy cirlces and their speed, and a projectile function which does much 
				the same as the spawn enemies function but for the projectiles shot by the user by clicking. A few other methods such as makePlayer and update are used inside the classes
				and they primarily deal with creating the the circles for the player, enemies and projectiles ( attributes, color, etc.), as well as updating based on where they should be going if it is a projectile or enemy.
				There is a sparate html file for the help page, and for the technical page, as well as a php file for adding and deleting the score.

<h2 style="font-size:200%;"> The Business Logic</h2>

<p style="font-size:150%;">
<b>The business logic of this project is a browser internet game that keeps the score and the highest score for the user as the user plays.
</p>	
		
<h2 style="font-size:200%;"> The Database Design</h2>

<p style="font-size:150%;">
<b>The database design is a php database using phpMyAdmin. Created using a SQL script. The database stores the scores. The score is updated as the user plays and the highest score is also stored.
</p>

<h2 style="font-size:200%;"> Special Features</h2>

<p style="font-size:150%;">
<b>Some special features are, the use of the innerwidth and innerheight of the canvasand margin of 0, this allows the game to go the full dimensions of the browser for a better playing experience.
I have also painstakenly figured out a way to removed the projectiles if they leave the screen to stop animation for a fast game experience.
As well as the addition of the buttons to take the user back to the game UI from the Help and Technical Docuents without refreshing the page.
