How the database feature works

The data store can be can created and modified through the prj.sql file, the data base is on phpMyAdmin.
Using the features "Add you score" and "Delete an existing score" on the html page to input the score ID and the points total and clicking
add your score then click view scores will update the database using the php code. Doing the the same procedure and clicking
delete an existing score then click view scores will use the php code to remove the score from the database.
